# ToDo List
This is a mini project named TO-DO List, which I built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The user interface is styled with CSS to provide a clean look, while JavaScript handles the logic to store and delete items from the list. By using this List, user can add their tasks. Also user can check and uncheck the listed tasks, and delete if needed.
